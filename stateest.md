### [Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python)
Reading to acquire a basic understanding of kalman filters.
#### Week 0 - Install and Preface
Installed anancoda and read through the Preface chapter.  This is my first experience with Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook.  Jupyter Notebook is a web application the author uses to share his text, with live, executable (in the browwser) code.  Anaconda comes with a package and environment manager (Conda) along with Python/R libraries for machine learning (scikit-learn), scientific computing (sciPy), plotting (Matplotlib) and more.
