### Continuing Education Opportunities
Re-evaluate current continuing education path.  Reseearch/consider alternatives and consider benefit to current job position (Autonomy Robotics) and desired career path.  To finish MS at UC boulder, need to complete three (3) more core embedded systems courses and three(3) electives. Ideally, could pick electives related to autonomy, robotics or embedded vision / visual perception.  Alternatively, could consider just getting graduate certificate (req. 2 more classes) and pursuing a second graduate certificate.
